## unreleased

- You can now set `I18n.missingBehavior='guess'` to have the scope string output as text instead of of the
  "[missing `scope`]" message when no translation is available

### enhancements

- You can now assign `I18n.locale` & `I18n.default_locale` before loading `i18n.js` in `application.html.*`
  (merged to `i18n-js-pika` already)
- Add support for +00:00 style time zone designator (https://github.com/fnando/i18n-js/pull/167)
- Add back rake task for export (`rake i18n:js:export`)
- Not overriding translation when manually run `I18n::JS.export` (https://github.com/fnando/i18n-js/pull/171)
- Move missing placeholder text generation into its own function (for easier debugging) (https://github.com/fnando/i18n-js/pull/169)
- Add support for milliseconds (`lll` in `yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.lllZ`) (https://github.com/fnando/i18n-js/pull/192)

### bug fixes

- I18.t supports the base scope through the options argument
- I18.t accepts an array as the scope
- Fix regression: asset not being reloaded in development when translation changed
- Requires `i18n` to be `~> 0.6`, `0.5` does not work at all
